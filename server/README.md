# Server | CRM Example

Contains source code for th API server.

Currently it only contains the [ExpressJS server](./crm-example-local-server/), that is used for local development (or potentially used in Docker).

The Serverless API and infrastructure is within the [`aws`](../aws/) folder of the root project directory.
